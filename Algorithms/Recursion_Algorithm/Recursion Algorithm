Recursion is a technique to call a function itself either directly or indirectly. Using recursion we can simplify complex problems.
Some common problems that can be solved using recursion includes calculating factorial, Fibonacci Sequence, Depth First Search, Tree Traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder).
Many problems which involves Dynamic Programming uses recursion. 
Recursion has two cases in it:
  1.Base case (The case to end recursion)
  2.Recursive Case (The case which calls the function recursively)

Recursion uses 'call stack' to store the function calls. Call stack uses basic stack operations, push and pop.
